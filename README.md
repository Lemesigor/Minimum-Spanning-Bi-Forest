# PBGM ( Minimum Spanning Bi-Forest)

PBGM is a application that implements the Primâ€™s Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm  to a variation of this problem in which the return of the algorithm is not the total cost of a tree, but a forest with exactly TWO  connected components.
It's part of the final avaliaton of Graph Theory class in Federal University of Rio Grande Do Sul. 


## Usage
Just compile the code  (or use the .jar file in /dist) and run it in terminal.

### Input :
The input has to be a Adjacency matrix graph formated as the following example:

```
7 
-1 4 -1 9 -1 -1 -1
4 -1 1 -1 1 -1 -1
-1 1 -1 -1 4 3 -1
9 -1 -1 -1 2 -1 1
-1 1 4 2 -1 5 2
-1 -1 3 -1 5 -1 -1
-1 -1 -1 1 2 -1 -1
```
Where the first line indicate the number of vertiches of the graph
